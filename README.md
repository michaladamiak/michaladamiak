### Memory game

The game is made in Vanilla JavaScript.
<!-- I know there are many tutorials of how to build such game, but I wanted to do it on my own from the very beginning. Therefore, I'm aware that the code itself is not perfect, but I'm still pleased with how this thing turned out. -->

You can check the [code](https://github.com/michaladamiak/memory) but I strongly suggest you to [try it out](https://michaladamiak.github.io/memory/)!

It's React App that allows you to plan your computer setup and calculate total cost of all elements. It saves your progress in local storage so that you can get back to it whenever you want.
