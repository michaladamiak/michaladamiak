## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚ and I'm trying to take my first steps to become software developer.

I'm currently studying Bid Data Analytics at Warsaw School of Economics. I've always been interested in design and creating products that you can interact with. That's why I want to take small turn on my career path and focus on software engineering rather than data analytics.

Here are some of the projects that I've been working on for the past few weeks: 

### Sample portfolio

This was the first site I've ever created on my own when I wanted to play with CSS. It contains form that allows you to send me an email, feel free to use it!

### Memory game

I know there are many tutorials of how to build such game, but I wanted to do it on my own from the very beginning. Therefore, I'm aware that the code itself is not perfect, but I'm still pleased with how this thing turned out.

You can check the [code](https://github.com/michaladamiak/memory) but I strongly suggest you to [try it out](https://michaladamiak.github.io/memory/)!

### Pac-Man-ish game

<img width="700" alt="Zrzut ekranu 2022-04-4 o 19 45 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102157058/161601638-26ef6b9c-ef37-4b0d-aa20-6707034be08b.png">

It's a simple variation about Pac-Man in JavaScript. The initial idea I got from Ania Kubow's tutorial on YouTube. I've spent few hours working on algorithm of movement for enemies but in the end, it works well and the game is quite challenging. Yet there are still few things that need to be done (maybe I will find some time to get back to this project in the future).

[Try it](https://michaladamiak.github.io/Pac-Man-ish/), you can also check the code [here](https://github.com/michaladamiak/Pac-Man-ish).

### Computer Setup Calculator

It's React App that allows you to plan your computer setup and calculate total cost of all elements. It saves your progress in local storage so that you can get back to is whenever you want.
