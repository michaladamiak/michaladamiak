## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚ and I'm trying to take my first steps to become web developer.

I'm currently studying Bid Data Analytics at Warsaw School of Economics. I've always been interested in design and creating products that you can interact with. Thats why I want to take samall turn on my career path and focus on software egineering rather than data analytics.

Here are some of the projects that I've been working on for the past few weeks: 

### Sample portfolio

This was the first site I've ever created on my own as I wanted to play with CSS. It contains form that allows you to send me an email, feel free to use it!

You can visit the site [here](https://michaladamiak.github.io/).

### Memory game

I know there are many tutorials of how to build such game but I wanted to do it on my own from the very beginning. Therefore I'm aware that the code itself is not perfect, but I'm still pleased with how this thing turned out.

You can check the [code](https://github.com/michaladamiak/memory) but I strongly suggest you to [try it out](https://michaladamiak.github.io/memory/)!

### Pac-Man-ish game

It's simple variation about Pac-Man in JavaScript. The initial idea I got from Ania Kubow's tutorial on YouTube. I've spend few hours working on algoritm of movement for enemies but in the end it works quite well and the game is quite challanging. Yet there are still few things that need to be done (meybe I will find some time to get beck to this project in the future).

[Try it](https://michaladamiak.github.io/Pac-Man-ish/), you can also check the code [here](https://github.com/michaladamiak/Pac-Man-ish).
